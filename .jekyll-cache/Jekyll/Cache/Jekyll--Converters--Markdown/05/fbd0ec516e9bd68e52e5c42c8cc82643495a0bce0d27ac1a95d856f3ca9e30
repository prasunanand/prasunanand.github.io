I"<p>ArrayFire-rb has been interfaced to NMatrix so that they can work together. Sometimes, copying data
from GPU memory to CPU memory and vice versa can be slower than the computation time. Hence, a lot of
developers prefer to use GPU computing for the most time consuming task. The interface between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayFire-rb</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NMatrix</code> helps in providing maximum freedom to the developers to use the libraries of their choice.</p>
