Prasun is a final-year student at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus, Goa, India pursuing a
dual degree in M.Sc. in Biological Sciences and B.E. in Chemical Engineering. He is a huge
supporter of Open-source software and loves Bioinformatics. He is involved with different
open-source projects aimed at super fast Scientific Computing on Ruby and D.

He is highly motivated to bring Scientific Computing to Ruby.

He worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2016** on the project **"Port NMatrix to JRuby"**.

He is currently working as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2017** on the project **"Creating the fastest math libraries
for Ruby/JRuby by using the GPU through OpenCL and ArrayFire"**.


## Programming

Prasun likes to program in C, C++, Java, D and Ruby. He is inclined towards using Parallelism for exploiting multiple cores
on CPU and is on the road to master **Heterogeneous Parallel Programming**.

He has been exploring the GPU world to create super-fast Math libraries for Ruby. One such effort is building the
[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rb) gem that wraps ArrayFire library and will make it easy
for programmers to use Ruby for **Big Data**.
