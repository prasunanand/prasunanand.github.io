I am a final-year student at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus, Goa, India pursuing a dual degree in M.Sc. in Biological Sciences and B.E. in Chemical Engineering. I am a huge supporter of Open-source software.

I worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for **Google Summer of Code 2016** on the project **"Port NMatrix to JRuby"**.

Recently, I have been exploring the GPU world. I am interested in creating super-fast Math libraries for Ruby. One such effort is building the [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rb) gem that wraps ArrayFire library and will make it easy for programmers to use Ruby for **Big Data**.
