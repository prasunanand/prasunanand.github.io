Prasun is involved with different open-source projects aimed at super fast
Scientific Computing on Ruby and D. He is a huge supporter of Open-source
software and loves Bioinformatics.

He is highly motivated to bring Scientific Computing to Ruby.

He worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2016** on the project **"Port NMatrix to JRuby"**.

He worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2017** on the project **"Creating the fastest math libraries
for Ruby/JRuby by using the GPU through OpenCL and ArrayFire"**.

He is currently working on with the [Genenetwork](https://github.com/GENENETWORK) project, building
GWAS tool for HPC devices, and [RbCUDA](https://github.com/prasunanand/rbcuda) project.

# Educational Qualifications

* M.Sc., Biological Sciences (2012 - 2017) <br>
 Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India

* B.E., Chemical Engineering (2012 - 2017) <br>
 Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India

# Programming

Prasun likes to program in C, C++, Java, D and Ruby.

He has been exploring the GPU world to create super-fast Math libraries for Ruby. One such effort is building the
[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rb) gem that wraps ArrayFire library and will make it easy
for programmers to use Ruby for **Big Data**.
