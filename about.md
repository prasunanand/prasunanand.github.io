Hi, I am Prasun and I am involved with different open-source projects aimed at super fast Scientific Computing on Ruby and D. I am a
huge supporter of Open-source software and loves Bioinformatics.

I am highly motivated to bring Scientific Computing to Ruby.

I am currently working on the [Genenetwork](https://github.com/GENENETWORK) project with University of Tennessee Health Science Center, building
`Faster-LMM-D`, a GWAS tool for HPC devices. Faster_LMM_D supports Linear Mixed Models. Bayesian Sparse Models are on the way. It has
a GPU backend that helps it run on CUDA and OpenCL environment.

I am also simultaneously working on [RbCUDA](https://github.com/prasunanand/rbcuda): CUDA bindings
for Ruby. The project has been awarded Ruby Grant 2017 by Ruby Association, Japan. RbCUDA is the fastest Ruby library
for matrix multiplication.


I worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2016** on the project **["Port NMatrix to JRuby"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/4640058522992640/)**.

I worked as a student developer for Ruby Science Foundation for
**Google Summer of Code 2017** on the project **["Creating the fastest math libraries
for Ruby/JRuby by using the GPU through OpenCL and ArrayFire"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5200694831218688/)**.

# Educational Qualifications

# Programming

I like to program in C, C++, Java, D and Ruby.

I love GPU programming and have built opensource libraries in D and Ruby that help in GPU acceleration. I am
the creator and maintainer of `ArrayFire-rb`, `ArrayFire-D`, `cuda_d` and `RbCUDA`.

I am highly-skilled in building data-intensive applications and speeding up the algorithms by modifying the code,
exploiting multicore CPUs and GPUs.

Very recently, I have developed an interest in Deep Learning and AI.
